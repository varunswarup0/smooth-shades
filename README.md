### 📄 About

Smooth Shades is a responsive React app that facilitates the creation, management, and access of color palettes for your next design project. Simply add colors using the built-in color picker or generate random ones. Use the drag and drop functionality to rearrange the order of the colors. Once your palette is ready, save it by giving it a name and a descriptive emoji. To access the colors in your palette all you have to do is adjust the lightness level of the colors, and click on a color box to copy its HEX, RGB, or RGBA values.

### 💡 What I learned from this project

**JSS**
**Overview** : Specifying CSS styles in JS, JSS scopes classes to the specific components they are defined in. These types of components automatically receive the JSS styles as part of their `props` through being exported *with styles* as *higher-order components (HOCs).* Another major advantage of JSS, other than the scoping of classes, is that it allows for dynamically computed styles based on the component's `props`.

**Setup, Import and usage:**

1. `npm install @material-ui/styles` (*Note:* this is just one option out of many for implementing HOC's)

2. `import {withStyles} from '@material-ui/styles'`

3. When exporting a component's styles with JSS, wrap the export as follows:

   `export default withStyles(styles)(MyComponent)`

   Where `styles` is an object whose keys act as CSS classes corresponding to values that are also objects containing key-value pairs of styles (*camelCased* instead of *kebab-cased* as in vanilla CSS).

   *For example:*

   ```jsx
   const styles = {
       myClass : {
           backgroundColor : white,
           textDecoration: none
       }
   }
   ```

   At initiation `MyComponent` receives `styles` as part of its `props`.
   If we `console.log()` `props`, we will see something like this:

   ```jsx
   Object
   	classes: { myClass: "MyComponent-myClass-17uslpf" }
   	__proto__: Object
   ```

   This means that the `props` contain an object consisting of the classes (in this case just `myClass`), each corresponding to a unique value (in this case `"MyComponent-myClass-17uslpf"`). This unique value is the class name that's being used under the hood instead of `myClass` to scope the class to this specific component.

   > Note: Inside the `styles` object, we have access to the component's `props`. So we can conditionally style based on the `props`.
